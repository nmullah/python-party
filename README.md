Greetings,

This repository contains beginner-intermediate practice problems using Python. As a bio grad from ucsb, my tech experience is existent! but must be deepened. I'm hoping to bridge gaps in our knowledge of our biology and the world, coding/ML/AI tools are the forefront of executing this change!!
