Greetings Mr. Li,

After a solid brush up on material, I was able to create a Google Search Query that would display the input of the user. The code worked in VS Code however for some reason would not show up when tested in the GitHub IDE. It's a simple solution so I'm hoping the logic will be easy to follow hopefully..
